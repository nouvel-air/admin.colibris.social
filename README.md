# admin.colibris.social

React Admin backoffice for the [Colibris ActivityPub server](https://github.com/reconnexion/colibris.social)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Configurations

By default the backoffice will be in port 5000, while it expects the middleware to run on port 3000. You can change this by editing the `.env` file or by adding a `.env.local` file.
